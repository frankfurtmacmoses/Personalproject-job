A separate main method for the Rorschach Watchman was created because when the Watchmen code is ran, Python tries to
speed everything up by caching a compiled version of each imported module starting from where the code is ran. This
caused compiled versions of the other Watchmen to be made, which led to errors because Rorschach is in SAAS and the
other Watchmen are in ATG. For example, a KMS decryption permission error was encountered because the script was trying
to decrypt the API key for the Comedian. Rorschach doesn't need KMS decryption permissions, and the API key for the
Comedian wouldnâ€™t work anyways because it only works in the ATG environment while prod Rorschach is in SAAS.

@note: this module includes the entry points for the Rorschach AWS lambda function.
       The Lambda function is configured by cron schedules; however
       it can be triggered by e.g. RDS and/or S3 event.

       - on S3 trigger, the handler will receive an event (JSON object) like
{
  "Records": [{
    "eventVersion": "2.0",
    "eventSource": "aws:s3",
